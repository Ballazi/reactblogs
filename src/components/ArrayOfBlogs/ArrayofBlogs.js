        title: "artificial intelligence",
        desc: "Back in the 1950s, the fathers of the field, Minsky and McCarthy, described artificial intelligence as any task performed by a machine that would have previously been considered to require human intelligence. That's obviously a fairly broad definition, which is why you will sometimes see arguments over whether something is truly AI or not. Modern definitions of what it means to create intelligence are more specific. Francois Chollet, an AI researcher at Google and creator of the machine-learning software library Keras, has said intelligence is tied to a system's ability to adapt and improvise in a new environment, to generalise its knowledge and apply it to unfamiliar scenarios. 'Intelligence is the efficiency with which you acquire new skills at tasks you didn't previously prepare for,' he said.'Intelligence is not skill itself; it's not what you can do; it's how well and how efficiently you can learn new things.'It's a definition under which modern AI-powered systems, such as virtual assistants, would be characterised as having demonstrated 'narrow AI', the ability to generalise their training when carrying out a limited set of tasks, such as speech recognition or computer vision.Typically, AI systems demonstrate at least some of the following behaviours associated with human intelligence: planning, learning, reasoning, problem-solving, knowledge representation, perception, motion, and manipulation and, to a lesser extent, social intelligence and creativity.",

        title: "Fruit and Vegetable Juice: How Food Affects Health",
        desc: "Fruits and vegetables are “juicy foods” that consist mostly of water, but they also provide a variety of vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, and a good amount of fiber that helps fill you up. Juice is another story. When whole produce is processed into juice most of the fiber is lost and you’re left with a less nutritious end product. And consider this: It takes a couple minutes to eat a 60-calorie orange but only a couple seconds to guzzle down a 110-calorie glass of OJ. Fruit juice, in particular, is a highly concentrated source of fruit sugar. This can raise your blood sugar quickly, and that’s why juice is not recommended for people with type 2 diabetes. Individuals with high triglycerides should avoid fruit juice as well, as its concentrated simple sugars can raise triglyceride levels even higher. Fruit drinks — not to be confused with 100 percent juices — are an even worse choice because they contain added sugars and less nutrition. Because both fruit juices and fruit drinks are calorie-dense and low in fiber, people trying to lose or manage weight should dramatically limit their intake and choose fresh, filling whole fruit instead. Vegetables are naturally lower in sugar than fruit, which means freshly made vegetable juice is lower in calories than fruit juice and can be a helpful way to “squeeze” more produce into your diet. However, bottled and canned vegetable and tomato juices are not generally recommended as they contain high amounts of sodium, which increases your risk of hypertension. While it’s better to get your nutrients and fiber from whole vegetable and fruit sources, juice does still contain vitamins and minerals. For example, certain juices are high in vitamin C and contain folate and minerals such as potassium. Some juices, like orange juice, may also be fortified with calcium. If you are going to drink juice, look for 100 percent juice that doesn’t have any added sugar or sodium. You can also make your own fresh squeezed or pressed juices at home. And you may want to consider diluting your beverage with water or calorie-free seltzer to cut calories and sugar. The vitamin C in some juices is largely responsible for the health of collagen, a protein that helps maintain healthy skin and cartilage. Eating and drinking vitamin C–rich fruits and vegetables will help replenish your skin’s vitamin C stores and enhance its natural beauty. Vitamin C also aids in joint flexibility and maintenance of healthy hair. Lastly, vitamin C may help prevent cataracts and macular degeneration. Some juices are fortified with the mineral calcium, which helps keep your bones healthy. Juices that contain calcium may be able to help lower blood pressure, reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease and prevent osteoporosis. Calcium may also help alleviate PMS cramping. Juices rich in potassium may further help prevent osteoporosis by forming osteocalcin, a protein found only in the bone. Drinking potassium-rich juice can also help keep blood pressure low. B vitamins like folate may reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, slow age-related memory decline, and help maintain healthy hair. Folate also contributes to the production of serotonin, so it may help ward off depression and improve mood. Aside from being a potential weight-loss buster, certain varieties of juice (mainly citrus juices) can trigger migraines in people who are sensitive. IBS sufferers take note: Some people with IBS are sensitive to sources of concentrated sugar like fruit juice and experience discomfort after eating them.",

        desc: "As per the latest news reports, Nepal will not be allowing people from third countries to travel to India by rail via the Kurtha-Jayanagar railroad. This move comes after Indian officials expressed security concerns, which was also confirmed by a senior official of the Department of Railways. Referring to this, the Director General of the Department of Railways Deepak Kumar Bhattarai stated, 'This was agreed while finalising the Standard Operating Procedure (SPA) for cross-border railway operation.' The SPA is a document that outlines the procedures that are to be adopted while operating the railway service. Reports have it that India and Nepal signed the SPA in New Delhi last month. As per the Director General of the Department of Railways, India's security concern was one of the reasons why it took so long to finalise the SPA. Reportedly, with India and Nepal sharing a porous border, India has always been cautious about the possibility of miscreants using the porous border to cause harm to India. And reportedly, both sides have suffered a lot from cross-border crimes over the last several years. Further, Bhattarai added that Nepal will now notify India regarding passengers on board to make sure that the security is cleared at the border point. He added that based on the ticket issued, they will then send details of passengers travelling to India. However, although the SPA has already been finalised, it is still not clear when the railway service will start, as the Nepal Government is yet to introduce a law on railway service and the Nepal Railway Company is yet to hire staff to operate the service.",

        desc: "The Akshay Kumar starrer Sooryavanshi released a while back, and since then the film has been doing brisk business at the box office. After opening to a thunderous response from the audience, the business of the film saw good growth as the days progressed. Being the first big ticket Bollywood entertainer to hit screens post the second lockdown, expectations from the film were at an all-time high. Not surprisingly, Sooryavanshi that saw a release across 3000+ screens, has surpassed expectations. In this box office report, we take a look at the second weekend collections of Sooryavanshi while comparing the same to Akshay Kumar’s previous releases that have made it to their second weekend in theatres. Collecting Rs. 30.57 cr, Sooryavanshi has become Akshay’s third highest second weekend grosser. Though the business of the film does not surpass the collections of Akshay’s previous releases like Mission Mangal that collected Rs. 36.45 cr, and Good Newwz that collected Rs. 34.20 cr. However, the business of the film surpassed the actor’s other releases like Housefull 4 that collected Rs. 29.98 cr, 2.0 that collected Rs. 27 cr, Holiday – A Soldier Is Never Off Duty that collected Rs. 19.52 cr, Airlift that collected Rs. 19.26 cr, Kesari that collected Rs. 19.15 cr, Toilet – Ek Prem Katha that collected Rs. 19 cr, and Jolly LLB 2 that had collected Rs. 17.73 cr.",

        desc: "In a latest development, Australia has decided to allow foreign visa holders to enter the country. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that the country has decided to allow foreign visa holders to enter from December 1. This step has been taken in order to restart international travel, and also support its economy. Much like the rest of the world, Australia too had shut its borders last year, with the spread of the COVID 19. At that time the country only allowed a limited number of permanent residents, and citizens to enter into the country. Eventually, the country had allowed foreign family members of citizens to enter into the country. Now, starting December 1, business visa holders, vaccinated students, and refugees will be permitted to enter. The country has also decided to allow vaccinated tourists from South Korea and Japan to travel from December 1. He said in a statement that allowing skilled workers and students to return to Australia, is a major milestone in getting the country back on its path. The country's foreign students are worth about A$35 billion a year to the economy of the country, and reopening for vaccinated students will be a major step towards getting that economic push for the better. The country is also quite popular as a tourist destination, and has some of the most beautiful beaches. Most notably, the Bondi Beach, which is an iconic beach located in the suburb of Sydney. To reopen such destinations safely would certainly mean the world for travellers!",

        title: "How Healthy is the Food You're Eating? Scientists Can Finally Rank It",
        desc: "People in today’s day and age have become very prudent about what they consume. However, with the influx of multiple brands, new foods, and establishments offering various types of edibles, it is crucial to have a system that rates the vivid variety of foods. Researchers at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts, have devised a nutrient profiling system that tallies and weighs the nutritional characteristics, and rates different kinds of foods depending on their effect on the overall health of the body. Monikered as ‘Food Compass,’ this tool has been developed after the research and development done across a period of three years and includes data collected on 8,032 foods and beverages consumed by the American populace, reported Tufts Now - the news website of Tufts University.        “Once you get beyond the general health advice related to food, the public is still oblivious to the method of ranking their meals and the choice of establishments offering food. Therefore, not just consumers, but policymakers and people associated with the food industry aim for guiding people towards healthier food habits,” Dariush Mozaffarian, Dean, Friedman School, was quoted as saying.                The Food Compass developed by the researchers’ analyses various foods and beverages around 54 different characteristics across nine domains. Abiding by the findings of the tool, people can expect a reinforced insight into the science of food, which will, in turn, make it easier for them to decide what to eat to lead a healthy lifestyle.                According to the Food Compass, anything with a score below 30 should be consumed to the minimum, followed by things falling in the range of 31-69, which should be consumed in moderation.   For example, snack and sweet deserts have acquired an average score of 16.4, which means that these edibles should be consumed with a pinch of salt (not literally). Vegetables and fruits have earned a score ranging between 73.9-100, which suggests that these should occupy a major part of your diet. Poultry scored 42.67, beef scored 24.9, while seafood scored 67 on the Food Compass.",

It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories., ·        Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware., ·        Application security focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed., ·        Information security protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit., ·        Operational security includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella., ·        Disaster recovery and business continuity define how an organization responds to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organization restores its operations and information to return to the same operating capacity as before the event. Business continuity is the plan the organization falls back on while trying to operate without certain resources., ·        End-user education addresses the most unpredictable cyber-security factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good security practices. Teaching users to delete suspicious email attachments, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and various other important lessons is vital for the security of any organization.Alphabet Inc.’s Google said it’s the rightful owner of patents on ways to keep music playlists in the cloud that form a key component of a lawsuit Sonos Inc. filed over the Google Play Music system. Sonos called that contention “nonsense.”        Sonos, an early proponent of connected home speakers, has claimed that Google gained knowledge of the technology through a partnership to integrate Google Play into the Sonos platform, and then decided to sell its own product line and undercut Sonos on price.              In a court filing Tuesday, the Alphabet unit said “Google, not Sonos, conceived of the cloud queue idea” and thus should be listed as owner and inventor of two of the Sonos patents. It also contends a 2013 Content Integration Agreement prohibits Sonos from claiming ownership of any technology developed during the partnership.",

The truth is that while some specific foods or nutrients have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mood, it’s your overall dietary pattern that is most important. The cornerstone of a healthy diet should be to replace processed food with real food whenever possible. Eating food that is as close as possible to the way nature made it can make a huge difference to the way you think, look, and feel.

        title: "Health Benefits of Berries",
        desc: "The antioxidants in berries can help your body fight oxidative stress caused by free radicals that can lead to illness. Eating a diet rich in antioxidants can help improve your health, protect your skin and hair, and prevent certain diseases. All fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants, but nutrient-rich berries are some of the absolute best sources. There are several powerful antioxidants that appear in berries, including anthocyanins, quercetin, and vitamin C. Anthocyanins give berries their vibrant color, reduce inflammation, and may help prevent and manage arthritis. Anthocyanins work together with quercetin to help slow age-related memory-loss. Quercetin can also decrease the inflammatory effects of chemicals in the synovial fluid of the joints for people with inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Vitamin C is another strong antioxidant found in berries. It is largely responsible for the health of collagen, which helps maintain cartilage stores and aids in joint flexibility. Eating vitamin C–rich berries will contribute to radiant skin and healthy hair, and may reduce the risk of arthritis, cataracts, and macular degeneration. In addition to antioxidants, berries are “juicy foods,” which means they contain mostly water. Juicy foods are great for losing weight because they fill you up quickly, since their high water content bumps up the volume while driving down the calories. Berries also contain fiber and folate. Fiber aids in weight loss and helps lower cholesterol and blood pressure. Folate may protect against cardiovascular disease and age-related memory loss, and since folate contributes to the production of serotonin, it may also help ward off depression and improve your mood. IBS sufferers take note: Some people with IBS experience discomfort after eating berries. Remember, if you can’t find fresh berries, frozen (unsweetened) berries are a good substitute during the off-season months — and just as nutritious!",

        title: "Health Effects of Meat",
        desc: "Meats like beef and pork are high in protein, but they can also contain a lot of saturated fat, so I recommend always choosing the leanest cuts of these meats. Protein can help you maintain a healthy weight, increase your lean muscle mass, and keep you feeling satisfied longer. In addition to being good sources of protein, meats like beef, pork, and ham contain other important nutrients, including iron, zinc, and the B vitamins — B6, B12, and niacin. Eating lean cuts of these protein-rich meats in place of their high-fat counterparts can help reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease and help keep your blood sugars balanced, which may lower your risk of diabetes. Vitamins B6 and B12 may help improve memory. Vitamin B6 is also involved in creating dopamine, a mood neurotransmitter that may reduce PMS symptoms. Both niacin and zinc help protect against vision problems: Niacin guards against cataracts, while zinc helps prevent and treat macular degeneration. Zinc, vitamin B12, and iron promote healthy hair. Iron also contributes to nail strength. Note that if you have gout, red meat can increase the uric acid in your body and exacerbate the condition, so even lean cuts should be eaten in moderation. The riboflavin in lean beef may help guard against migraines, but aged beef and any cured, smoked, or canned beef or pork product can be a migraine trigger in individuals who are sensitive.",

Firstly, those intending to travel to Canada should be fully-vaccinated as well. The permission to allow travellers jabbed with Covaxin will come into effect from November 30. An important fact to remember is that the second dose of vaccine must be taken by travellers at least 14 days before their arrival in Canada. The decision was announced by the Public Health Agency of Canada, stating that, 'Beginning Nov 30, the #GOC will expand its list of #Covid19 vaccines accepted for entry to Canada to include Sinopharm, Sinovac and COVAXIN. Travellers must have received a full vaccine series at least 14 days before entry to Canada.' Last week, Canada announced an expansion of its list of approved COVID-19 vaccines, bringing in respite for a large number of travellers who have been wanting to visit the nation. India, of course, is home to a high number of people who have ties with Canada, who have been eagerly awaiting such a decision.",

Big data is a term applied to data sets whose size or type is beyond the ability of traditional relational databases to capture, manage and process the data with low latency. Big data has one or more of the following characteristics: high volume, high velocity or high variety. Artificial intelligence (AI), mobile, social and the Internet of Things (IoT) are driving data complexity through new forms and sources of data. For example, big data comes from sensors, devices, video/audio, networks, log files, transactional applications, web, and social media — much of it generated in real time and at a very large scale. Analysis of big data allows analysts, researchers and business users to make better and faster decisions using data that was previously inaccessible or unusable. Businesses can use advanced analytics techniques such as text analytics, machine learning, predictive analytics, data mining, statistics and natural language processing to gain new insights from previously untapped data sources independently or together with existing enterprise data.",

        desc: "Israel has become the first country in the world to shut its borders for foreign travellers owing to the Omicron scare. Soon after, Japan followed suit and barred foreign travellers from entering into the country. A number of countries have reported confirmed or suspected cases of the Omicron, the new variant of COVID-19. The new variant has already been discovered in Australia, Botswana, Britain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands and Scotland. Israel has not only banned entry of foreigners but has also made quarantine for all Israelis arriving from abroad mandatory. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said, 'Restrictions on the country's borders is not an easy step, but it's a temporary and necessary step. 'The government of Japan also said that they would shut its borders to foreigners amid rising cases of the Omicron variant of Coronavirus. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said that he is ready to take criticism for being too cautious.",

        desc: "Switching to a healthy diet doesn’t have to be an all or nothing proposition. You don’t have to be perfect, you don’t have to completely eliminate foods you enjoy, and you don’t have to change everything all at once—that usually only leads to cheating or giving up on your new eating plan. A better approach is to make a few small changes at a time. Keeping your goals modest can help you achieve more in the long term without feeling deprived or overwhelmed by a major diet overhaul. Think of planning a healthy diet as a number of small, manageable steps—like adding a salad to your diet once a day.

        desc: "The Akshay Kumar starrer Sooryavanshi released a while back, and since then the film has been doing brisk business at the box office. After opening to a thunderous response from the audience, the business of the film saw good growth as the days progressed. Being the first big ticket Bollywood entertainer to hit screens post the second lockdown, expectations from the film were at an all-time high. Not surprisingly, Sooryavanshi that saw a release across 3000+ screens, has surpassed expectations. In this box office report, we take a look at the second weekend collections of Sooryavanshi while comparing the same to Akshay Kumar’s previous releases that have made it to their second weekend in theatres. Collecting Rs. 30.57 cr, Sooryavanshi has become Akshay’s third highest second weekend grosser. Though the business of the film does not surpass the collections of Akshay’s previous releases like Mission Mangal that collected Rs. 36.45 cr, and Good Newwz that collected Rs. 34.20 cr. However, the business of the film surpassed the actor’s other releases like Housefull 4 that collected Rs. 29.98 cr, 2.0 that collected Rs. 27 cr, Holiday – A Soldier Is Never Off Duty that collected Rs. 19.52 cr, Airlift that collected Rs. 19.26 cr, Kesari that collected Rs. 19.15 cr, Toilet – Ek Prem Katha that collected Rs. 19 cr, and Jolly LLB 2 that had collected Rs. 17.73 cr.",
